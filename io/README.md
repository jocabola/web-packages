I/O Package written in TypeScript.
Includes AssetsBundle to handle syncronous preloading of assets for THREEjs projects.

You can create as many Assets Bundles as you wish, and handle loading accordingly.

This is part of a series of packages that I use in my studio for personal and commercial web & [THREEjs](https://threejs.org) based work. It might remain undocumented for a long while but feel free to try it out!
