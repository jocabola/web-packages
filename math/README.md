# @jocabola/math
This package is discontinued. It has moved here: [https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fils/math](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fils/math)

Math package for jocabola/web. Written in TypeScript.

Uses [mersenne](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mersenne) for better random number generators.

This is part of a series of packages that I use in my studio for personal and commercial web & [THREEjs](https://threejs.org) based work. It might remain undocumented for a long while but feel free to try it out!
