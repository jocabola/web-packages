# @jocabola/web-packages
This is a repository containing a set of tiny libraries, utilities and wrappers which I use for both my personal work and studio's commercial web & [THREEjs](https://threejs.org) based work.

The libraries are written in TypeScript and all of them are available as individual NPM packages. Some of them are built on top of [ThreeJS](https://threejs.org/) and may have other dependencies.

It might remain undocumented for a long while but feel free to try it out!
