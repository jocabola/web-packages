Verlet Physics Package written in TypeScript. Ported from [FieldKit](https://github.com/marcuswendt/FieldKit.js). This package is based in a CoffeeScript package I used in a few projects while sharing studio and collaborating with [FIELD](https://field.io).

This is part of a series of packages that I use in my studio for personal and commercial web & [THREEjs](https://threejs.org) based work. It might remain undocumented for a long while but feel free to try it out!
